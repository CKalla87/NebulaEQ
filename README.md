## Philosophy

NebulaEQ was built around one idea:

Clarity creates space.

Sometimes EQ is about fixing problems. Sometimes it is about discovery. NebulaEQ lives between precision and creativity, encouraging subtle moves or bold decisions depending on where the sound leads.

If it sounds wrong, you are probably close.  
If it sounds perfect, try pushing it further.
